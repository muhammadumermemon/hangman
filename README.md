# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The game selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of tries to guess the word correctly before the game ends.

## Description

This Hangman game is a fun and interactive Python script where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn. It's a great way to practice Python programming and enjoy a classic word game!

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Visual representation of the hangman stages.
- Input validation for letters and words.
- Keeps track of guessed letters and words.
- Displays messages for correct and incorrect guesses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd hangman-game
    ```

3. **Install any dependencies (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Implementation

The Hangman game is implemented in a single Python script (`hangman.py`). Here's a brief overview of the main functions:

- `get_word()`: Selects a random word from a predefined list.
- `display_hangman(tries)`: Returns the current state of the hangman based on the number of tries left.
- `play()`: The main function that runs the game, handling user input and game logic.

## How to Run

1. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```

## Example

```plaintext
Let's play Hangman!

|   |
O   |
/|\  |
/ \  |
    |
--------
_ _ _ _ _ _

Please guess a letter or word: a
a is not in the word.

|   |
O   |
/|\  |
/    |
    |

_ _ _ _ _ _

Please guess a letter or word: o
Good job, o is in the word!
-----
|   |
O   |
/|\  |

Congrats, you guessed the word! You win!
