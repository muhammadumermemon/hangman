# hangman
This Hangman game is a fun and interactive Python script where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn. It's a great way to practice Python programming and enjoy a classic word game!
